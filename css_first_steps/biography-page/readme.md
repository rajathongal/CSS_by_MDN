# Styling a biography page

With the things you have learned in the last few lessons you should find that you can format simple text documents using CSS to add your own style to them. This assessment gives you a chance to do that.

## Starting point

You can [download the starting point file to work with in your own editor](https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/main/learn/getting-started/biog-download.html). This is a single page containing both the HTML and the starting point CSS (in the head of the document). If you prefer you could move this CSS to a separate file and link to it when you create the example on your local computer.

## Project brief

The following live example shows a biography, which has been styled using CSS. The CSS properties that are used are as follows â€” each one links to its property page on MDN, which will give you more examples of its use.

- `font-family`
- `color`
- `border-bottom`
- `font-weight`
- `font-size`
- `font-style`
- `text-decoration`

Make the following changes to this CSS:

1. Make the level one heading pink, using the CSS color keyword hotpink.
2. Give the heading a 10px dotted `border-bottom` which uses the CSS color keyword `purple`.
3. Make the level 2 heading italic.
4. Give the ul used for the contact details a `background-color` of `#eeeeee`, and a 5px solid purple `border`. Use some `padding` to push the content away from the `border`.
5. Make the `links` green on hover.
